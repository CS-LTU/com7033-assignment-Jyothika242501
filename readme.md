# HS StrokeApp – Heart Stroke Prediction System

HS StrokeApp is a secure Flask-based web application designed to manage and analyse
anonymised healthcare data related to stroke, heart disease, and hypertension.
The system provides clinicians and healthcare researchers with dashboards,
visual insights, and patient management tools while following secure software
development and ethical data-handling practices.

## Features

- Secure user registration and login
- Mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Patient analytics dashboard with visualisations
- CRUD operations for patient records
- Filtering and searching patient data
- Stroke and cardiovascular risk analysis
- Secure session handling and password hashing

## Project Architecture

HS StrokeApp is built using a modular Flask architecture to ensure scalability,
maintainability, and security.

### Architecture Overview

- **Frontend**
  - HTML5, CSS3
  - Bootstrap for UI styling
  - Jinja2 templating engine
  - Chart.js for data visualisation

- **Backend**
  - Python 3 with Flask
  - Blueprint-based routing
  - Flask-Login for authentication
  - PyOTP for MFA (TOTP-based authentication)

- **Database**
  - SQLite database
  - Stores user credentials and patient records securely

- **Data Layer**
  - CSV dataset imported into the database
  - Anonymised patient data used for analysis

## Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

To ensure high security standards, HS StrokeApp enforces **mandatory MFA**.

### MFA Workflow

1. During registration, a unique TOTP secret is generated for the user.
2. A QR code is displayed for scanning using an authenticator app:
   - Google Authenticator
   - Microsoft Authenticator
   - Authy
3. On every login, users must provide:
   - Email and password
   - A valid 6-digit OTP generated by the authenticator app

### Security Benefits

- Prevents unauthorised access
- Protects sensitive healthcare data
- Mitigates credential theft risks
- Aligns with healthcare security best practices
